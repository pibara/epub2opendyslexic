# epub2opendyslexic
Simple python web server for converting Smashwords epub files to an  OpenDyslexic release of the same book.

I occasionaly have a server running on a VM on my home PC, feel free to test out my work in progress if the server happens to be online. Just rememeber its still a work in progress at the moment.
